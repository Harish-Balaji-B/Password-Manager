# Password-Manager
In developing a secure client-server model, we implement the Advanced Encryption Standard  (AES) and a hashing algorithm from scratch. The AES implementation includes key expansion, key-mixing operations, and secure modes like Cipher Block Chaining (CBC). For hashing, we choose SHA-256 and ensure its resistant to common cryptographic attacks.
